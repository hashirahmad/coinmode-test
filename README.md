# CoinMode JavaScript Project

Usage of external libararies is allowed should you require them, if you get stuck on anything feel free to contact your main contact within CoinMode for assistance.

The purpose of this is to understand your level of JS knowledge and how you tackle challenges.  It is recommended to add comments with any code you write.

## Pre-requisites
You will need to install `NodeJS` and `npm` in order to work with this test application. Once you have those installed you should be able to run `node -v` or `npm -v` in a command-line or terminal and they should output the version numbers that you have installed.

This should work on both Windows and Linux environments however only recently tested with Ubuntu environment.

We work with Ubuntu environments in house so if appropriate please use a linux based OS while editing this.
You may find VSCode helpful to edit the files but use whatever editor you are familiar with.

# Setup the project

You can pull this repository to your local computer for development, `git pull https://git.coinmode.com/ext/cointest.git` should pull it to your local folder

Install the dependencies with 

`npm install`

# Writing some code

There is a file called `app.js` in the root of this repository, you should do the following:

1. Pull the source-code
2. Inspect the source code to see what the comments say
3. Complete the functions in app.js where TODO is written.
4. Run `npm run test` to see if your functions pass the unit-tests
5. Suggest improvements to the test you'd like to see other candidates try

Please remember your code doesn't have to pass all the tests, we mainly want to see how you tackle challenges.  If you get stuck let us know.  Passing the tests is merely icing on the cake.

Tip: run `npm run dev` to get continuous output from your code as you write it.
